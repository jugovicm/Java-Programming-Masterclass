Create a program that implements a playlist of songs.
To start you off, implement the following classes:
1.  Album
    -  It has three fields, two Strings called name and artist, and an ArrayList that holds objects of type Song
 called songs.
    -  A constructor that accepts two Strings (name of the album and artist). It initialises the fields and
instantiates songs.
    -  And three methods, they are:
        -  addSong(), has two parameters of type String (title of song), double (duration of song) and returns
 a boolean. Returns true if the song was added successfully or false otherwise.
 -  findSong(), has one parameter of type String (title of song) and returns a Song. Returns the Song if
 it exists, null if it doesn't exists.
        -  addToPlayList(), has two parameters of type int (track number of song in album) and LinkedList (the
 playlist) that holds objects of type Song, and returns a boolean. Returns true if it exists and it was added successfully
 using the track number, or false otherwise.
        -  addToPlayList(), has two parameters of type String (title of song) and LinkedList (the playlist) that
 holds objects of type Song, and returns a boolean. Returns true if it exists and it was added successfully using
 the name of the song, or false otherwise.

2.  Song
    -   It has two fields, a String called title and a double called duration.
    -  A constructor that accepts a String (title of the song) and a double (duration of the song). It
initialises title and duration.
    -  And two methods, they are:
        -  getTitle(), getter for title.
        -  toString(), Songs overriding toString method. Returns a String in the following format: "title: duration"
