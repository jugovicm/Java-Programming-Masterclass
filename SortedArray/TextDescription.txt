Create a program using arrays that sorts a list of integers in descending order.
Descending order is highest value to lowest.
In other words if the array had the values in it [106, 26, 81, 5, 15] your program
should ultimately have an array with [106, 81, 26, 15, 5] in it.
Set up the pro so that the numbers to sort are read in from the keyboard (Scanner).
Implement the following methods:
    1) getIntegers has one parameter of type int which is the size of the array. It returns an array of entered integers from the keyboard.
    2) printArray accepts an array and prints out the contents of the array. It should be printed in the following format:
            Element 0 contents 106
            Element 1 contents 81
            Element 2 contents 26
            Element 3 contents 15
            Element 4 contents 5
    3) sortIntegers accepts the unsorted array. It should sort the array and return a new array containing the sorted numbers.
