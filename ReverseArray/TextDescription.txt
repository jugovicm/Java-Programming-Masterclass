Write a method called reverse() with an int array as a parameter.
The method should not return any value. In other words, the method is allowed to modify the array parameter.
To reverse the array, you have to swap the elements, so that the first element is swapped with the last element and so on.
For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then the reversed array is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].
