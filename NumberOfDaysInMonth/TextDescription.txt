Number Of Days In Month
Write a method isLeapYear with a parameter of type int named year. 

The parameter needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 9999.

If the parameter is not in that range return false. 

Otherwise, if it is in the valid range, calculate if the year is a leap year and return true if it is, otherwise return false. 

A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or it is divisible by 400.
